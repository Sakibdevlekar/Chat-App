Our Chat App backend, powered by Node.js with Express, Mongoose, Socket.io, Cloudinary, and Express Validator, ensures real-time communication, efficient data management, and secure file uploads. Leveraging these technologies, we've built a scalable and robust backend system for seamless chat functionality.
